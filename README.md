## Euler Sim

So this is really unfortunate it seems my README has gone missing I must have
accidently removed it the last time I merged main rip the original README.

The current version will be re-written in julia because it's just much easier to
deal with differential equations in julia, additionally julia has a lot of the
math stuff already built in so I don't have to worry about that anymore.
