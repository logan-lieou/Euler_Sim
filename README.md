## Euler Fluid Simulation ðŸ’¦

Something with like fluids and water bro it's water air dude let's gooo dude.

## Sources

I saw this in a youtube video originally but there was no source code available.
I went on a search to find some source code for this idea I found some and the
implementations were using SFML so I decided to use SFML. This seems like a 
common choice for stuff like this. 
When I realized that the code online was done by a bunch of noobs I decided that I
must make this myself because not only am I getting super washed up, I should also
learn some C++. Web is aids and cancer so, it's time to do something that 
is more interesting as well as honing my pro gamer C++ skills.

Now how am I going to implement this? Well first I need to figure out how to use
SFML, and second I must understand Euler equations the second part is easy mode
but the first part I must figure how to use SFML so here are my sources:
